See [Chat Application](https://github.com/jlam55555/chat) for more details regarding the chat application and its workings.

This extension is identical to the main chat application save that it resides in a popup, closes when it loses focus, has a loading screen, and has the [TheHomeworkLife](https://github.com/jlam55555/the-homework-life) logo on it.
